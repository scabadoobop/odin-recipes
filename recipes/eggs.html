            What can I say, I'm a <strong>chef</strong>. I'm going to have to put a 
            lot of words in here before this starts <em>looking</em> like a paragraph.

        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>

            Steps to make:
        </h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients, <em>Mise en place</em>, or something. ha ha, I swear I can cook.</li>
            <li>Break the eggs into a <strong>microwave-proof</strong> mixing bowl. Add milk, salt and pepper to taste; mix well.</li>
            <li>Pop the bowl into the microwave and cook on high power for 30 seconds. This step is great for the ADHD brain.  Retrieve bowl, beat eggs very well, scraping down the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Repeat 3, stirring every 30 seconds for up to 2 1/2 minutes. Stop when eggs have the consistency you desire.</li>
        </ol>
