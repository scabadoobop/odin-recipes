# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - recipes exercise


This is an attempt at a Recipe Website

I want to demonstrate my understanding of elements, tags and concepts in HTML:

* Paragraphs
* Headings
* Bold
* Italic
* Links - absolute / relative
* Images
* File Structure

Once I begin my leap into CSS. It is my understanding that I will revisit this website and give it some style.
